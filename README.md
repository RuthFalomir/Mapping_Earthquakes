# Mapping_Earthquakes

This time, we have an exciting project to share to our online community. We worked as data visualization specialists for the Disaster Reporting Network. This is a non-profit company that provides data-driven storytelling on disasters around the world. 
Our mission was to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes around the world.

We worked with the latest earthquake geoJson data available from the US Geological Survey website. We used the javascript, d3 and leaflet libraries to retrieve the data and mapbox to plot it.

Our maps present the magnitude and location of each earthquake with a pop up marker. Besides, the diameter of the markers reflect the magnitude of each earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color with a legend providing context for each map's data. The most important part is that tectonic plate locations were also added to the maps in order to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates. 

Here are visual pictures of how our awesome maps look like:
